      Welcome to my projects gallery! Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of my work that blends creativity, technical prowess, and a bit of fun. 
      From innovative AI solutions to full-stack web applications, these projects are more than just codeâ€”they represent my journey as a developer and my passion for solving real-world problems.
      <br/>
      Feel free to explore each project to see how they were built, the challenges faced, and the solutions created. 
      Whether you're here to learn, collaborate, or just browse, I hope these projects inspire you as much as they inspired me while building them. Dive in, tinker with the code, and let's build something amazing together! âœ¨
